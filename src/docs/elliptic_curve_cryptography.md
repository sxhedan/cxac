# Elliptic Curve Crytography

Elliptic curve crytography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography). Elliptic curves for cryptographic purposes satisfy the equation
$$
y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
